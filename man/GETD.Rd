\title{Generalized Extended Triangular Designs}
\usage{
GETD(n, m, trt = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{It is a natural number such that n >= 2m ; m >= 2}

\item{m}{It is a natural number such that m >= 2}

\item{trt}{Provide any treatment number to know its all associates. By default it is 1.}
}
\value{
This package generates an m-associate (m >= 2) class PBIB designs under GET Association Scheme. It also calculates the Information matrix, Average variance factor, canonical efficiency factor and different treatment associates of the generated designs.
}
\description{
This package contains a function named GETD() for generating m-associate (m>=2) class PBIB designs along with parameters (v, b, r, k and lambda_i, i = 1, 2,â€¦,m) and the underlying Generalized Extended Triangular (GET) Association Scheme.
